# Simulation-Based Counterfactual Causal Discovery on Real World Driver Behaviour 
The data and code here relate to a counterfactual causal discovery framework and the experiments evaluating it, both relating to the autonomous driving domain.

## Code
The code for the framework as well as any utility scripts.

## Data
Data relating to the experiments carried out upon the framework. Note that the experiments referred to here rely upon the High-D dataset which is free for non-commercial use by application at the following link: https://www.highd-dataset.com/. However, as the dataset is not public, only the output experiment data is available in this repository.

## Paper
Corresponding conference paper accepted at IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium 2023 (Pre-print): https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03354
